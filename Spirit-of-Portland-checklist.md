# Things to do to make anywhere feel more like Portland
## Places to go
* Spend more than 2 hours in a coffee shop that isn't Starbucks; go to a different coffee shop afterward.
* Sell 3-5 items at a used goods store, then shop there on that budget.
* Eat a lunch and dinner at your most Polrtland restaurants (in Flagstaff: Macy's Cafe, Pizzicleta).
* Find an underground band at a local venue and cheer for them.
* Complete a grocery shopping trip at a farmers' market and/or on a bike.

## Out in public
* Ask to take a photo with somebody's pet in public; post photo with the hash tag ‪#civilrights‬
* Talk to a stranger at a music store; try to get them to use a specific word in a sentence.
* Try three beers you've never had before, if possible, from a trendy bar you've never been to.
* Participate in a protest, maybe even one that you organize.

## From home
* Play in a one-day-only friends & family garage band; record one song and publish it on a blog.
* Pickle a vegetable.
* Make a work of art out of things around the house or outside.
* Listen to two music albums published in the 90s.

## Online
* Sign a petition on change.org, petitions.whitehouse.gov, or a similar site.
* Watch a movie on Netflix.
* Make a blog post about your Portland adventures.
